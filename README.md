# Ensemble Learning Project

A comprehensive machine learning project demonstrating various ensemble learning techniques including bagging, boosting, and stacking methods. This repository provides hands-on examples, implementations, and best practices for building robust ensemble models.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Ensemble learning is a powerful machine learning paradigm that combines multiple models to achieve better predictive performance than any individual model. This project covers:

- **Bagging Methods**: Random Forest implementation and analysis
- **Boosting Methods**: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost
- **Stacking**: Meta-learning approaches for model combination
- **Real-world Applications**: Practical examples with sample datasets

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 **Ready-to-run Jupyter notebooks** with comprehensive examples
- 🐳 **Docker support** for easy deployment and sharing
- 🧪 **Comprehensive test suite** for all ensemble methods
- 🔄 **CI/CD pipeline** with automated testing and deployment
- 📚 **Professional documentation** with detailed guides
- 🛡️ **Security scanning** and code quality checks
- 🎨 **Pre-commit hooks** for consistent code formatting

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is with Docker:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ensemble-learning-project

# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8888
# Open the ensembles.ipynb notebook
```

**Alternative Docker commands:**
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t ensemble-learning .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/app ensemble-learning
```

### Option 2: Local Development

For local development, you can use `uv` (recommended) or `pip`:

#### Using uv (Recommended)
```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone and setup
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ensemble-learning-project
uv sync

# Start Jupyter Lab
uv run jupyter lab
```

#### Using pip
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ensemble-learning-project

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start Jupyter Lab
jupyter lab
```

### Option 3: GitHub Codespaces

You can also run this project directly in your browser using GitHub Codespaces:

1. Click the green "Code" button
2. Select the "Codespaces" tab
3. Click "Create codespace on main"
4. Wait for the environment to provision
5. Open `ensembles.ipynb` notebook
